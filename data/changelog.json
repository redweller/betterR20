Please do inform me of any other shapes I forgot to add.\n- Has a \"sticky\" mode, which will persist the last-drawn ruler to the table, so you can switch tool and do something else without losing your measurement. Press SHIFT while ruler-ing to enable it, or check the box.\n- [Note: I think I managed to get all this to properly sync to anyone else running the script, too. Ergo, with a mere 4 players acting in unison, it should be possible to use the ruler tool to draw dicks.]\n- Added a line-cutter tool . Largely stolen from here: https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/3190495/slug%7D (but instead of drawing a pink line and typing a command, you just click on a line to break it)\n- Added player-only Edit Config button and config options, currently very limited, but includes the ability to toggle half-grid snap\n- Added a Wild Shape Sheet Builder tool, credit to @ Bodrick\n- Fixed missing monster fluff when importing monsters from an adventure\n- Fixed \"hidden until edited\" monster save/skill import issue"

Note that they maintain their internal IDs, so you can't really use this to copy pages\n- And it wouldn't be 5etools without a bit of Robin-Hoodery; there's a button to load content exported straight from Roll20's published adventures. Sadly, there's (so far) only the two that I happen to own, and W:DH which was kindly donated to the cause. I forgot to ask if this person wanted credit, but they're pretty cool.\n- If you happen to own adventures other than CoS, SKT, or W:DH, please do drop me a PM with an invite to a minty-fresh copy of whatever module, and we can get this thing filled out. We caught them all. - Removed \"The Semicolon\" [I think exactly one person had noticed this, but there was a rando semicolon floating in the top-left corner of the screen.]\n\n- With regards to the map importer/exporter, more interesting is the fact that, in theory there's no reason the same technique can't be applied to the entire contents of a module (or, indeed, any custom game). Certainly something worth looking into in the (near?) future."

You'll just have to live with the floating tokens instead.\n- Restored missing \"Sort Alphabetically\" button in Transmogrifier\n- Get it here: https://get.5e.tools/script/betteR20-5etools.user.js?v=1.16.5, or see the pinned post in #better20-issues\n\nAdditionally, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that betteR20 development is in \"maintenance only\" mode. The real party is happening over in #foundry-general, where the greatest VTT to have ever not been Fantasy Grounds just announced a big update with the final piece of their puzzle; drawing tools.

		"txt": "- (Hopefully) added support for Roll20's \"new\" dynamic lighting\n- Overhauled the way in which the script loads 5etools dependencies, freezing it at the current version. Some consequences of this change are:\n- Updates to 5etools won't break the Roll20 script\n- Many \"compatibility updates\" will no longer be mandatory; a copy of the script will now function as if brand-new until a Roll20 update eventually renders it useless\n- Updates to 5etools data (e.g. new Bestiary content) won't automatically be reflected in b20, requiring a b20 update instead\n- Note that the Module Importer/Exporter, while its source is hosted as 5etools data, is unaffected by this change, and any new modules added to that library will be immediately available\n- Changes to the structure of homebrew data may create incompatibilities with b20, requiring a b20 update to resolve\n- The script is now a (significantly) larger download, but should load faster\n- With this move we're aiming to provide a more stable and maintainable update cycle, with less breakage and downtime. Additionally, this change has produced a clean separation between 5etools and betteR20, allowing each to be updated without fear of breaking the other (this, historically, has been the cause of the vast majority of the script's issues).\n\nThis system has been in use by Plutonium (my Foundry module) since its inception, and has been highly successful. Hopefully this success can be reproduced in the badlands of Roll20."
